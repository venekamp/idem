# v0.1.0 — Initial release

**idem** is a command-line tool for discovering identical files across one or more
directories, helping to safely identify candidates for cleanup and disk-space
recovery.

This initial release focuses on **indexing and content identification**.
Reporting and review workflows are intentionally minimal.

## Highlights
- Recursive indexing of configured root directories
- Content-based file identification using SHA-256
- Low-memory, resumable indexing backed by SQLite
- Parallel hashing with bounded concurrency
- Safe handling of disappearing files and symlinks
- Deterministic, restartable indexing process

## Current limitations
- Does not yet present duplicate files in a user-facing report
- Does not yet flag or group ambiguous duplicates for manual inspection
- No interactive review or deletion workflow

## Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/venekamp/idem.git@v0.1.0
